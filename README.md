# Python-Project-Anomaly-detection-

This Python project detects anomalies in a continuous data stream using a Z-score-based algorithm. 
It simulates real-time data with seasonal patterns and noise, identifying outliers that deviate significantly from the norm.
The system also allows user input for custom data simulations and provides real-time visualization of both the data stream and detected anomalies. 
The project is designed for efficiency, robustness, and includes clear documentation and error handling.

This is a big project and i was unable to upload the zip folder so here is the link to download the folder from Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BD7FW78hs49JUYyXwLD7c0HuGgx3VcnV/view?usp=drive_link
or you can email me for the project.
